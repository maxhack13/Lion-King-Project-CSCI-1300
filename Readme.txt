this is what I do to compile:

g++ -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic -std=c++17 -o testfile Board.cpp player.cpp game.cpp  GameDriver.cpp

to run the program:
./testfile   

P.S. I got ascii art from websties and commented where I got it from.
     also, the loading animations are my ideas I just didnt know the syntax so i looked it up. 
     They dont affect my project in any way besides visual aspects.
